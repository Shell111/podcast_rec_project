- The Podcast Rec is a full stack CRUD application, created to store, create, share and display podcast recommendations for registered users.
- The app was developed and tested for use in Google Chrome Version 90.0.4430.93
- App users are required to log in or register before being able to sumbit podcast recommendations or update any show information.
- Tech wise: the app uses Ruby, SQL, HTML and CSS, and has been created on the Sinatra Framework.

## Technologies used
- Ruby
- SQL
- Sinatra 
- Gems
- HTML
- CSS
- Database tables exist for Podcast content, Users and Likes. 

## Background
- This project brief called for a full stack CRUD application, created to store, create, share and display podcast information to registered users.
- Users wishing to submit and update recommendations are required to register and sign in to the app.
- All app information (user, podcast and like details) are housed in a related database.
- Ruby and SQL have been used for all CRUD actions via RESTful routes.
- The app is optimised for use on desktop, iPhone and iPad.
- Podcast information can be submitted to the database and displayed in the front-end.

## Approach
- Create a database and tables in SQL to contain data for the podcast content, users, and likes.
- Create the app folder framework in Heroku.
- Create SQL queries to retrieve, create, update and delete data from these tables.

- Create Ruby functions to manipulate the SQL data:
-- to display, update, create and delete data in the database for podcast, user and likes tables.

- In the Sinatra main.rb make active the models, controllers, ERB files for podcasts, likes, sessions and user methods. 
-- Include gems being used.
-- Run bundle command in the terminal to ensure all gems created.

- In Controllers files create the routes for GET / POST / PUT / DELETE methods: 
-- include any data being captured by params or variables being used.
-- Call the related functions.

- To display podcast information on the homepage, run a loop within the ERB page:
-- to retrieve specific podcast data to display, such as podcast title or image.

- Use the podcast_id to link through to the show.erb page to display a single podcast.

- Add a form to the show.erb to delete a show (using DELETE route method).

- Add button on the show.erb page to edit a podcast, connecting to a separate form using the PUT route method to update content in the database.

- Ensure user has be logged in to undertake any delete or edit method, using Sessions methods and If/Else statements.

- Create form for users to register using POST route method.
-- Use params to capture the information submitted, and add bcrypt gem to query

- Create form for users to log in using Sessions and Post route methods.
-- Use params to capture the information submitted, and add bcrypt gem to query

- Create log out functionality.

- Create form for users to submit a new podcast using POST route method.
-- Use params to capture the information submitted.

- Add form to podcasts/index.erb page to register and display 'likes'
-- To enable 'likes' displaying create an array from the podcast-results
-- Loop through results using the count_like query to retreive the 'likes' table data and iterate through podcasts.
-- create variable to display 'like-count' on the erb page.

## Future updates
- User profile pages to come, including what recommedations they have submitted or liked (such as user history).
- User to be able to to save a recommendation to their profile.
- Catologue of shows to be searchable.
- Filtering of shows according to genre.


## Bugs
- Responsive design can require reloading.
- User needs to log in after registering.
